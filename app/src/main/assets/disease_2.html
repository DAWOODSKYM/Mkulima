  <h3>What to do</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Avoid planting in soils that are high in undecomposed organic matter, such as fields just coming out of pasture or in very weedy conditions. Flies prefer to lay eggs in soil that is moist and with high organic matter. Do not plant onions unless the plant residues are dry and completely decomposed</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">In soils amended with animal manures, allow adequate time for the manure to break down before planting.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Avoid planting successive onion crops. Practise rotation with crops not related to onions</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Keep onion fields well separated. Onions grown in the season following an attack by onions flies should be sown as far away from infested land as possible.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Remove and destroy infested plants and burn them.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">To prevent an infestation with onion flies, carefully plough-under crop residues immediately after harvest.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Turn soil to destroy pupae</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Powdered hot pepper or powdered ginger placed around the stems helps when the onion fly population is moderate.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Neem-based products have a deterrent effect on egg-laying</li>
