        Leafminers may cause damage to green onions. Damage is largely cosmetic, and mining on leaves may cause rejection of marketed onions, but generally does not affect plant growth. Damage in dry onions and garlic is of little concern unless populations become high to prematurely kill foliage.

  <h3>What to do</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Varieties with waxy foliage are generally more resistant than those with glossy leaves.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Increased ploughing between seasons may reduce the disease.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Increased spacing between plants also may reduce disease development.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Other good practices include seed treatment, rotations, removal of crop debris and planting in well-drained soil.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Under conventional production system fungicides are used when the disease is severe. In organic production systems no direct measures are allowed.</li>
