        Leafminers may cause damage to green onions. Damage is largely cosmetic, and mining on leaves may cause rejection of marketed onions, but generally does not affect plant growth. Damage in dry onions and garlic is of little concern unless populations become high to prematurely kill foliage.

  <h3>What to do</h3>

        <li class="list-group-item">Leafminers are usually controlled by natural enemies, especially parasitic wasps. They can become a problem in areas with a high use of pesticides that kill natural enemies. Leafminers have the ability to develop resistance to pesticides in a short time.</li>
