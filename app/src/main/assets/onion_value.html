  <h3>Dried Onion</h3>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Onion varieties with pungent flavor are most appreciated, both colored and white onions may be used.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">After removing the tops, roots and outer skin, onions are washed carefully then cut at a right angle to the core of the onions. </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Blanching is not practiced, as the onion loses its flavor. </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">The use of preservatives is not necessary: after cutting, the slices are spread evenly on the trays of a dryer.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">The onions are dried when the ratio of prepared raw material to drier product is about 9:1 (moisture content 5%). </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">he dried product may be ground to a powder, which tends to make clumps. The dryer used for onions must be reserved especially for onions. </li>
